        <p>Hi there!</p>
        <p>
          My name is Oleg, and I am a beginner front-end web developer. I just
          recently started my coding adventure so this page is my first and only
          project so far. I hope though, within a short period of time I will be
          able to present here some interesting and original
          <a href="projects.html">projects</a> that will be worth your
          attention.
        </p>
        <p>
          And in case this modest page was enough and you are willing to have a
          beginner developer in your team, I will be glad to
          <a href="/contact.html">hear</a> from you.
        </p>
